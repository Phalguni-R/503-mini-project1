Project Title: The connection between Remote Work and Housing Market Trends (2000-2024)

Description:
This project explores how remote work has reshaped housing markets across urban, suburban, and rural areas in the U.S. from 2000 to 2024. Using publicly available data from Zillow, I performed exploratory data analysis and  modified the dataset to align with my problem statement. I analyzed housing price trends, identified key shifts during and after the pandemic, and visualized the impact of remote work on real estate.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, filtered datasets, and prepared data for analysis.

Visualizations: Created interactive charts (line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots) to highlight trends and insights.

Insights: Discovered how suburban and rural areas are closing the gap with urban markets, driven by remote work.

Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

CSV/Excel datasets
